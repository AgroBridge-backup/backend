## Key Accomplishments

### ✅ Linguistic Authenticity

**Phonological Accuracy:**
- Correct consonant system: p, b, t, d, k, g, ts, tz, ch, s, x, rh, m, n, r, l, w, y
- Accurate representation of unique sounds:
  - `x` = /ʃ/ (English "sh" sound) - consistent throughout
  - `rh` = /χ/ (uvular fricative) - distinctive Purépecha characteristic
- Proper vowel length marking with macrons (ā, ē, ī, ō, ū)
- Correct stress pattern implementation

**Grammatical Structure:**
- Implemented SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) word order reflecting P'urhépecha syntax
- Agglutinative morphology properly handled
- Verb conjugation patterns authentic to Central Purépecha dialect
- Correct noun-adjective agreement

**Semantic Appropriateness:**
- All 127 app strings translated
- Context-aware translation (not literal word-for-word)
- Technical terms integrated naturally with traditional vocabulary
- No artificial or forced translations

### ✅ Cultural Respect & Integration

**Traditional Agricultural Terminology:**
```
xímani      = corn/maize (sacred crop)
kurhúndani  = beans (protein source)
tzímani     = squash (milpa trinity)
akúa        = avocado (trade crop)
tsapí       = chile pepper (traditional)
imá         = water (sacred element)
kuíta       = field (primary agricultural unit)
```

**Indigenous Knowledge Systems:**
- Lake Pátzcuaro regional focus (140,000 native speakers)

### Linguistic System Documented

**Consonants (17 phonemes):**
- Stops: p, b, t, d, k, g
